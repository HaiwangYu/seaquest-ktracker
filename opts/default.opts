# when set to 1, the X-hodo hits from both TW-TDC will be merged into the hits
# from v1495 TDC for future hodoscope masking, trigger road reconstruction,
# and trigger road masking
# It's recommended to turn on for Run-II data, off for Run-III and after
MergeHodoHits 0

# when set to 1, tracker will drop all the chamber hits that are not covered
# by a fired hodoscope.
# This also affects TriggerMask option, if HodoMasking is not enabled,
# Trigger masking will be applied on track level during tracking, instead of hit level
HodoscopeMasking 1

# when set to 1, only the hodo paddles on a trigger road will be used
# for hodoscope masking
TriggerMask_enable 1

# when set to 1, tracker will update the alignment/calibration info
# before real tracking, it should only be used when there is a need
# to update the alignment and/or calibration
# DO NOT toggle when OnlineAlignment_enable is 1
UpdateAlignment 1

# when set to 1, tracker will enable the sagitta hit reducer
SagittaReducer 1

# when set to 0, only the SRecEvent will be saved to the output file,
# and SRawEvent will be missing to save space.
# This option is only effective in file-based tracker
